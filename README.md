# RTOS for ESP32

## Introduction

FreeRTOS is a popular real-time operating system for microcontrollers and small embedded systems. 
## Benefits of FreeRTOS for ESP32

- **Real-Time Capabilities**: FreeRTOS allows you to create real-time applications on the ESP32, ensuring that critical tasks get executed on time.

- **Multitasking**: It supports multitasking, enabling you to run multiple tasks concurrently, making efficient use of the ESP32's resources.

- **Task Management**: FreeRTOS provides robust task management features, including task creation, deletion, priority management, and synchronization primitives.

- **Low Memory Footprint**: FreeRTOS is designed to have a low memory footprint, making it suitable for resource-constrained microcontrollers like the ESP32.

- **Synchronization and Communication**: FreeRTOS provides various synchronization and communication mechanisms such as semaphores, mutexes, queues, and event groups for task coordination.

- **Software Timers**: It offers software timers to execute functions at specific intervals or after a delay.

- **Interrupt Handling**: FreeRTOS allows you to write interrupt service routines (ISRs) that can interact with tasks and queues safely.

- **Portable and Open Source**: FreeRTOS is highly portable and open-source, making it widely adopted and supported by a vibrant community.

## Functions in FreeRTOS for ESP32

### Task Management

- `xTaskCreate`: Create a new task.
- `vTaskDelete`: Delete a task.
- `vTaskDelay`: Delay a task for a specific period.
- `vTaskPrioritySet`: Set the priority of a task.
- `xTaskCreatePinnedToCore`: Create a task pinned to a specific core.

### Synchronization and Communication

- `xSemaphoreCreateBinary`: Create a binary semaphore.
- `xQueueCreate`: Create a queue for inter-task communication.
- `xMutexCreate`: Create a mutex.
- `xEventGroupCreate`: Create an event group for efficient event handling.
- `xTaskNotify`: Notify a task without the need for a semaphore.

### Software Timers

- `xTimerCreate`: Create a software timer.
- `xTimerStart`: Start a software timer.
- `xTimerStop`: Stop a software timer.
